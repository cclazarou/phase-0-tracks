  <h1>Electronic Music</h1>
  <p>I'm <strong>finally</strong> familiarizing myself with common electronic music tools, which I've avoided for years because I was too <em>cool</em> to use anything but analog instruments.  I'm doing so now because:
  <ul>
    <li>I have to do it for a Halloween coverband.</li>
    <li>I've aged out of being cool anyway.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Turns out it's pretty fun!  It's fun in the following ways:
    <ol>
      <li>It's nice having a new palette to work with after getting used to guitars and pianos.</li>
      <li>It's interesting observing the similarities between learning electronic music tools and programming for web development.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>Here's one of the things I'm playing with (or at least a fake plugin version of it because it's less than $3000 or whatever a real one is): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog">minimoog</a></p>
  <p>So far I've learned that the compositional tendencies that electronic musicians have, usually born of the tools available, can be avoided by simply avoiding them.</p>
