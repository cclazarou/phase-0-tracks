What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

resources:
http://api.jquery.com/
https://devdocs.io/jquery/
https://devdocs.io/jquery/

testing:
every time I add a distinct new action

breaks:
every 5 mins every 35 minutes

how to approach topic:
1. state goal
2. pseudocode
3. consult resources
4. code

This is the general approach I take to our programming challenges, and it's worked so far with some tweaking along the way.  Today I'm going to concentrate on the pseudocoding portion, since I tend to rush into coding.
