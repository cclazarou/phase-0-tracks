# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is keeping different versions and updates of a program organized and traceable. It is useful because it allows us to roll back or forward among different versions of a program.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is like a separated copy of a program that allows us to work on it without affecting the other branches. It is useful because it allows multiple people working on different features of same project at the same time and also easier to manage what is updated.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is like a saving point during programming. A good commit should be succinct but at the same time clear about what is being changed or updated.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is an error or conflict that happens when trying to merge two branches together.
