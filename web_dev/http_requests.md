A GET request is an http request for specified data. A POST request is an http request to submit data to be processed.

GET requests can be bookmarked, shared, and cached, but have length restrictions and post the query in the URL.

POST requests can't be bookmarked, shared, or cached, but they don't have length restrictions and the query is sent in the body of the http request as opposed to the URL.

Ex. of GET:
used to pull images specified by img tag in html page

Ex. of POST:
form submission
