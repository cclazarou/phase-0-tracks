A virtual private server is a collection of resources on a server dedicated to one user, though the server may have some of its resources allocated to other users simultaneously.

A VPS is useful if you'd like some of the server's resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) dedicated to your purposes to guarantee a certain level of performance, but you don't want to invest in a dedicated server.  Additionally, using a VPS gives you flexibility and control in terms of server administration, similar to administering a dedicated server.
