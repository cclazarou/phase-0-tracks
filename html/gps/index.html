        <p>
          You know? Dealing with soft targets, and it's just strafing runs in my
underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these

'those people', and I have cleansed myself.

        <p>You know, he might be Nails, but I'm frickin' bayonets, you know? I am
battle-tested bayonets, bro. .... And then, I just got to add this: There
was a whole firestorm yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our
crew. And let me just say this ... this is all I'm gonna say about it:
Where there were four ... there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good
luck in your travels ... you're gonna need it ... badly... So ....</p>
